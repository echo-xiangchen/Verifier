-- test conjunction with initialized boolean variable declaration with propositional value (with error)
p : BOOLEAN = true
q : BOOLEAN = not p or p
q : BOOLEAN = not p
verify q and not p
r : BOOLEAN = p and q
t : BOOLEAN = p or q
verify r and t1 and not p and q
verify t1 and r
t2 : BOOLEAN = t1 => q
t3 : BOOLEAN = p <=> t2
verify t3 and t2 and not t1
